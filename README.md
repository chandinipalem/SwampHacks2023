The app Keep It Green The app takes a user-input city name and parses an EPA dataset containing information pertaining to cleanup sites around the state of Florida. The program then plots a list of potential locations that the user could choose to volunteer at. The user can join a cleanup group at any of the locations listed. When a group has reached its capacity of eight members, registered users will be sent a notification containing the cleanup details. 

The project was built entirely using Python on the PyCharm IDE. We used the Pandas, GeoPy, Kivy, and KivyMD libraries.
